📚 Library Management System – SQL Project
This project is a complete SQL-based Library Management System designed to organize books, authors, publishers, borrowers, and branch information in a structured relational database. It demonstrates how SQL can be used to manage, analyze, and generate insights from real-world library operations.

🎯 Project Objective
The objective of this project is to understand how a library functions by creating a well-structured SQL database and analyzing:
Book distribution across branches
Borrower activity
Availability of books
Loan frequency and branch performance
Author-level book insights
The goal is to transform raw data into meaningful insights that help improve library management and decision-making.

🔍 Key Analysis Queries (Use Cases)
The following major SQL queries were used to analyze library operations:
1️⃣ Copies of “The Lost Tribe” in the Sharpstown branch
2️⃣ Copies of “The Lost Tribe” across all branches
3️⃣ Borrowers who have no books checked out
4️⃣ For loans issued from Sharpstown branch on 2/3/18, retrieve book title + borrower details
5️⃣ For each branch → total number of books loaned
6️⃣ Borrowers who have more than 5 books checked out
7️⃣ All books authored by Stephen King and available copies in the Central branch
These queries help understand demand, usage, availability, and borrower behavior.

📝 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to effectively manage and analyze a library’s data. By building the database schema and performing analytical queries, we gained insights into:
Book demand across branches
Borrower habits
Inventory planning
Branch performance
Overall, the project shows how structured data + SQL queries support smarter decision-making and improve daily library operations.
